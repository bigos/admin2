* README

This was attempt to create a simple admin app, because the old apps do not seem
to work with the new assets.

New default application uses https://github.com/rails/propshaft, and changes the
way the assets are handled.

But then I found
https://github.com/railsadminteam/rails_admin
also consider
https://trestle.io/
https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate
